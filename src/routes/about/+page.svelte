    <h1>Inlet.Shop</h1>
    <p>Inlet.Shop is an online shopping mall for Murrells Inlet and the surrounding area. We aim to assist businesses in the area by providing a cheap and easy platform to reach customers online and sell or display their items. We also hope to help customers to purchase locally. By creating a local online market, we hope that people will be able to better find and purchase locally made/produced goods and support the community.</p>

    <p>Created in early 2025, Inlet.Shop was created by <a href="https://inletsites.dev">Inlet Sites</a>, a software development company based locally, right in Murrells Inlet.</p>

    <p>We hope that as a customer, you can discover products and shops right here locally, whether you purchase through the Inlet.Shop platform, or visit the businesses in person.</p>

    <p>We hope that as a business, you can sell your items here as cheap as possible and have new customers driven to your business</p>
